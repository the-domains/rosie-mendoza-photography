description: 'A year ago (exactly) I started shooting real estate. Truth is, Big Shout Out is in order, going to Glen Jakob P.A., who not only brought the idea to me but keeps on supporting me daily. Seriously, daily.  My skills have close to nothing to do with my accomplishments. It is all about strong willing, believing in myself and having kick ass friends who cheer me up along the way... 1 year and counting, Yay!  I might now be shooting 24M properties and such but still excites me to photograph 300K homes. Being a part of my clients success is my pride. ‪#‎teamwork‬'
